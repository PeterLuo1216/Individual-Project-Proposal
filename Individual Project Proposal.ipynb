    "First Analysis: Self-Identity and Mental Health\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Question: Is there a link between self-identity and mental health scores in the CSCS dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "1:DEMO_identity_lgbtq: LGBTQ+ self-identification\n",
    "2:PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_negative_affect_score: Negative emotions about body image (higher scores = more negativity)\n",
    "3:PSYCH_big_five_inventory_neurotic_score: Emotional instability (higher scores = more instability)\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations:\n",
    "Violin Plots: Show body dissatisfaction and negative affect scores for LGBTQ+ vs. non-LGBTQ+ groups, revealing density and variation.\n",
    "Grouped Bar Charts: Compare mean neuroticism between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: Bootstrapping\n",
    "Separate data by identity, analyze body dissatisfaction and neuroticism.\n",
    "Draw 1,000 bootstrap samples, calculating the mean or median for each group.\n",
    "Generate confidence intervals and compare them. Non-overlapping intervals suggest meaningful differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: LGBTQ+ individuals may report higher dissatisfaction and neuroticism scores than non-LGBTQ+ individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: Results will highlight mental health disparities, supporting awareness for underrepresented groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Analysis: Age and Mental Health\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Question: How does age affect mental health scores, like neuroticism and body dissatisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "1:DEMO_age: Age\n",
    "2:PSYCH_big_five_inventory_neurotic_score: Emotional instability\n",
    "3:PSYCH_big_five_inventory_extraverted_score: Extraversion\n",
    "4:PSYCH_body_self_image_questionnaire_height_dissatisfaction_score: Height dissatisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations:\n",
    "Box Plots: Display neuroticism and body dissatisfaction across age groups.\n",
    "Summary Statistics: Present mean and standard deviation for each age group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "Define age as the independent variable, mental health scores as dependent.\n",
    "Fit a model to determine how scores change with age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Older individuals may have lower neuroticism, while extraversion may change unpredictably with age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: Identifying age-related mental health patterns can help in targeted interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third Analysis: Provincial Differences in Personality\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Question: Are there provincial differences in personality traits and well-being?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "1:GEO_province: Province of residence\n",
    "2:PSYCH_big_five_inventory_agreeable_score: Agreeableness\n",
    "3:PSYCH_big_five_inventory_conscientious_score: Conscientiousness\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations:\n",
    "Box Plots: Compare personality traits and well-being across provinces.\n",
    "Mean Comparisons: Show average personality scores by province.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: Bootstrapping\n",
    "Separate data by province, analyze agreeableness and conscientiousness.\n",
    "Draw 1,000 bootstrap samples, calculate the mean or median, and generate confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Agreeableness and conscientiousness may vary between provinces, influenced by cultural or environmental factors.\n",
    "Relevance: Revealing these differences supports discussions on regional mental health needs, aligning with the projectâ€™s objectives."
